published date : 2021 title : creating business domain concepts in regional projects : in the case of japan authors : m. tanifuji, k. uenishi summary : this paper explores the formation of business domain concepts in regional projects, focusing on industrial clusters and green energy initiatives in japan. using the ishikari region of hokkaido as a case study, the research examines how organizations collaborate across industry, academia, and government to establish sustainable regional development projects. the study applies the concept of ba, a framework in knowledge creation management, to analyze the interactions and decision - making processes that contribute to the success of regional projects. the study highlights the role of ba in fostering cooperation among diverse stakeholders, enabling knowledge sharing, and expanding the boundaries of collaboration. a key case examined is the " snow and cool heat energy project, " which utilizes natural cold air for industrial and commercial applications. the research details how companies, local governments, and universities worked together to transform this concept into a viable business model, supported by government grants and technical expertise. the involvement of third - sector organizations ( joint public - private entities ) played a crucial role in bridging business interests with regional policy objectives. findings suggest that regional entrepreneurship, particularly kirznerian and schumpeterian entrepreneurial approaches, influences the success of projects by shaping their direction and ensuring long - term viability. the study concludes that expanding the ba framework to include external funding sources, flexible membership, and inter - organizational cooperation can enhance the effectiveness of regional business projects. it also suggests that future research should explore the theoretical boundaries of ba in organizational studies to better understand its role in regional development. reference : tanifuji, m., & uenishi, k.
