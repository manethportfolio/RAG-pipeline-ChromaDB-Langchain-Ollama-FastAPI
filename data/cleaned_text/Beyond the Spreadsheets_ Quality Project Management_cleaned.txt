published date : november / december 2020 title : beyond the spreadsheets : quality project management authors : rachael vernon waters, dr. syed adeel ahmed summary : this paper examines the limitations of project management tools and software in addressing critical human and strategic factors that influence project success. while modern project management methodologies emphasize efficiency, cost reduction, and on - time delivery, many projects still fail due to neglected factors such as stakeholder engagement, leadership oversight, and change management. the study identifies ten key failure points, including poor customer focus, inadequate risk management, lack of accountability, and insufficient post - implementation planning. the research highlights how project teams often prioritize technical execution over stakeholder relationships, leading to misalignment with organizational goals and reduced project adoption. findings from enterprise system deployment projects illustrate how overlooking human factors — such as role clarity, leadership engagement, and change readiness — results in delays, resistance, and inefficiencies. the study advocates for a strategic project management approach that integrates leadership, change management, and stakeholder alignment into project planning and execution. to mitigate these issues, the paper recommends defining clear project roles, establishing formal feedback mechanisms, improving vendor accountability, and implementing structured change management practices. it also underscores the need for project managers to develop interpersonal skills, leadership competencies, and a customer - focused mindset to enhance project outcomes. the authors argue that sustainable project success requires a shift from rigid process adherence to a holistic, quality - focused approach that considers both technical execution and human dynamics. reference : waters, r. v., & ahmed, s. a.
